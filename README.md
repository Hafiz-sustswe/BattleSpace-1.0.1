# Battlespace 1.0.1

## Overview
Battlespace 1.0.1 is a space shooting game developed using the Java LibGDX framework. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and battles enemy ships while navigating through space. The player has three lives to progress through the game.

## Features
- **User Control**: Players can control their spaceship using keyboard inputs.
- **Enemy Ships**: Various enemy ships appear in waves, each with different behaviors and attack patterns.
- **Lives System**: The player starts with three livesâ€”each collision with an enemy ship or projectile results in losing one life.
- **Score System**: Players can earn points by destroying enemy ships.
